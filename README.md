# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
This is the First Project for the Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow at Udacity.

In this projet, the template code has been mostly provided, however it is my responisbility to complete the following:
1. Complete the 'to-do' lists and answer relevant questions on the learning algorithms selected.
2. Employ several supervised alogorithms taught in the lessons and accurately model individual's income using data collected from the 1994 U.S Census.
3. Implement the model to understand if an individual's income can help a non-profit organisation can select the right people for donation based on selected features such as 'age' ,'occupation' etc

Key takeaways from this project are:

- Perform some basic statistical analysis of the data.
- Choosing the best supervised model for the job (theres a lot to choose from) and explanations as to why 3 were selected as well as pro's, con's and usage scenarios for each.
- Optimizing the final supervised model and explaining the reasoning.
- Effects of Feature Selection and how the selected algorithm of my choice, and how the model's F-score relates to the final result.


More information will be provided in the ipynb file.
